## Become a Sponsor to freeCodeCamp

In 2014, a teacher started an open source community called freeCodeCamp.org. This community has grown to include millions of developers from around the world. Together, we have built:

üíª A free 3,000-hour programming curriculum

üèõÔ∏è Forums and chat rooms where you can get coding help and feedback on your projects

üß™ 8,000+ coding tutorials

üéí 1,000+ free YouTube courses on Computer Science, Data Science, and Machine Learning

We are fully donor-supported. And we are extremely capital-efficient.

Last year our budget was only about $400,000. And yet we served more than 1 billion minutes of learning.

Each dollar you give to freeCodeCamp.org translates into 50 hours worth of learning for people around the world.
